For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
- 
For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
- 
What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
- 
What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
